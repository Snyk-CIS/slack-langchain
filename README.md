# Slackbot that uses langchain under the hood

```bash
# Getting started
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 
# To run it locally (no need to use ngrok or anything)
./run_local.sh

# Now you can talk to the bot on slack
@bigbrain Tell me a joke.
```

# TODO:

* Deploy the bot somewhere like Heroku
* Make the bot have a green dot if it's online or a grey dot if not
* Make the bot respond with markdown
